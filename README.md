# OculusStorm

Legacy C++ Oculus Rift VR library by VoxelStorm, as used in early versions of the game [sphereFACE](http://sphereFACE.com) and experimental versions of [GolfXTRM](http://golfxtrm.com).

Depends on [VectorStorm](https://github.com/VoxelStorm-Ltd/vectorstorm).

This is now significantly outdated, having been based on the Oculus Rift Development Kit, and is provided without support in the hope that it will be useful.

See also the [VRStorm](https://github.com/VoxelStorm-Ltd/vrstorm) library which replaced this for VoxelStorm projects later.
